# Landing-Page

This is the first project I will be completing using my new knowlege of HTML and CSS.  The project will rely heavily on my knowledge of Flexbox.  I found Flexbox to be hard to understand at first, which is why I believe it necessary to use it heavily in the project - to solidfy my understanding of the tool.
